# Hometap
I decided to use the FLask Web framework in Python, because it is very lightweight, simple to understand/use, and has built in support for APIS. 
The House Canary documentation was pretty easy to understand so I simply read it through until I found the correct end point to use. The endpoint ended up being the property/details, with the url being https://api.housecanary.com/v2/property/details, and then I added on some test parameters for one to use. 

I then called the API with the get request in order to get data from the API. I then parsed through it, in order to get the data that I really care about, which is the sewer data. 

Once I get the sewer data, I simply passed the returned data to a variable. If the variable is equaled to "Septic", then the Flask app outputs "ask user for another question. If it does not equal Septic, then it returns "No more information needed".
